function newRect = CenterRectOnPointd(rect,x,y)
% newRect = CenterRectOnPointd(rect,x,y)
% 
% CenterRectOnPointd offsets the rect to center it around an x and y position.
% The center of the rect is reported by RectCenterd. This is the same as
% CenterRectOnPoint, just that it returns floating point results instead of
% results that are rounded to integral pixel positions.
%
% rect can be a rect array, and/or x and/or y can be vectors instead of
% scalars.
