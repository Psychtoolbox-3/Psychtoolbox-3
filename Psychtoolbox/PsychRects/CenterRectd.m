% 
% Center the first rect in the second. It does the same as CenterRect but
% without rounding to integer pixel position for the rect corners.
%
% rect and fixedRect can both be Mx4 rect arrays, but either for one of
% them M must be 1, or rect and fixedRect must have the same shape. If rect
% contains multiple rects and fixedRect only one, each rect is centered in
% fixedRect. If fixedRect contains multiple rects, but rect only one, rect
% is centered in each of the fixedRects. If both rect and fixedRect are
% arrays with the same number of rects, each rect is centered in the
% corresponding fixedrect
