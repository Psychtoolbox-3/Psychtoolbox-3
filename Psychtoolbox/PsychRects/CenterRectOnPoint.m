function newRect = CenterRectOnPoint(rect,x,y)
% newRect = CenterRectOnPoint(rect,x,y)
% 
% CenterRectOnPoint offsets the rect to center it around an x and y position.
% The center of the rect is reported by RectCenter.
%
% rect can be a rect array, and/or x and/or y can be vectors instead of
% scalars.
