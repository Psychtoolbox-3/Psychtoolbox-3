function newRect = OffsetRect(oldRect,x,y)
% newRect = OffsetRect(oldRect,x,y)
%
% Offset the passed rect-array by the horizontal (x)
% and vertical (y) shift given. You can also pass in column vectors x
% and/or y with e.g., n different "shifts" and the function will return n
% copies of oldRect, each shifted by one of the shift values in x and y.
%
% Alternatively you can give a single scalar x,y shift value, but apply it
% to a whole matrix of rects 'oldRect' --> Apply a common offset to a large
% number of rects simultaneously.

% 5/16/96  dhb  Relented to Pelli's request to change calling order
%               from v,h to x,y.
%          dhb  Index using RectTop etc.
% 7/10/96  dgp  Wrote it.
% 8/5/96   dgp  Check rect size.
% 5/18/08  mk   Vectorized.
% 5/31/09  mk   Improved error handling. Add support for offsetting a
%               single rect multiple times, ie., pass x,y as vectors, then
%               create many offset versions of single input rect.
% 7/27/15  dcn  Made offsetting a single rect multiple times more flexible,
%               only x or y being a vector is allowed now. Simplified
